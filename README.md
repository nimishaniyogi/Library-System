Steps for Exceution: 

To run the program, download the zipfile, copy the src folder and the input file into a netbeans project.  Be sure the input.txt file is in the same directory as the src folder in the netbeans project.  Then you can run from the netbeans environment.  If you want to add the inventory in the input.txt file to the program's persistent storage (the Library.o file), then choose the Add New Inventory option, then choose the Add An Inventory File option, when asked enter the name of the input file "input.txt", be sure to use the same case.  You can use a different file, but you must have the same format as the input.txt file for each different class of inventory.
